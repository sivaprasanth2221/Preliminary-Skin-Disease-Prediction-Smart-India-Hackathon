Early diagnosis of skin diseases such as HIV and skin cancer is critical for improving patient outcomes. However, access to specialized healthcare providers can be limited, especially in rural and underserved areas.Our idea is to develop a mobile application for the preliminary diagnosis of skin diseases, with a focus on HIV, Elephantesis and skin cancer. The application uses MobileNet and Attention mechanism to analyze images of skin lesions and provide a diagnosis. The dataset used for the model is HAM10000.The preprocessed dataset is then fed to the model that is capable of predicting nearly 2 major classes(skin cancer and HIV) with 6 subclasses for skin cancer. In future, the number of disease predicted can be extended with improving the data and quality. Our application is a promising tool that can assist the doctors which can be used to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare disparities.
